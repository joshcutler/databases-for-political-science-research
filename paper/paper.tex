\section{Introduction}

With rows representing observations and columns representing variables, the rectangular
table is the root of most social science research. Tables are built into \R as
either \texttt{matrix} or \texttt{data.frame} objects (and other more
specialized versions). In \Stata, the table is so ingrained as to be
invisible. In both systems, these data objects form the primary input to
routines for description, analysis, and plotting. The frequent use of tables
drives how data are archived and publicly released. It is safe to say, most statistical analysis
is probably carried out on variants of \texttt{.csv} files (or proprietary
equivalents).

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
  \hline
  Subject ID & Favors Treaty & Friends & Country & Signed Treaty \\\hline
  1          & 1             &         & USA     & 1             \\
  2          & 0             & 1       & USA     & 1             \\
  3          & 0             & 4       & Mexico  & 0             \\

\label{tab:examplesurvey}
\end{table}
  
If the simple table and related formats have proved so popular, why should
social scientists consider alternative methods of storing and retrieving data?
We motivate our answer with the following example. Imagine a team of
researchers
conducting a multi-country survey. The team has data on country level
variables, for example whether the country signed a particular treaty, and
data on individual citizens, such as an attitude measure regarding the treaty.
Table~\ref{tab:examplesurvey} shows how these data are arranged in a
rectangular table. The rows represent individual responses, but also carry
country level variables, in this case treaty membership. Additionally, the
``Friends'' column indicates the result of a social network question in which
respondents are asked if they know other members of the survey (e.g.
respondent 1 does not list any friends, while respondent 5 knows and is known
by 6 and 7).

Imagine that during the course of analysis, it is realized that while Canada
signed the treaty, it did so \emph{after} they survey was in the field. For
each Canadian respondent, the treaty status has to be updated. Additionally,
the researchers wish to include additional data on each country,
necessitating updating every row, even though there are only a few countries in
the dataset. With collaborators at different institutions, it quickly becomes
onerous to ship around updated copies of the data. At one point, two
researchers mistakenly edit the data file at the same time, and one erases the
other's changes. After these issues are resolved, the researchers turn
attention to analyzing the network effects. With a variable number of friends,
restructuring the table to account for the connections is no easy task.
Additionally, analysis was going to be carried out using a specialized graph
analysis package written in Python, which had trouble reading the researchers'
\texttt{.dta} file. Again
the researchers must turn their attention from the substantive question to
solving data issues.

While none of the problems encountered by the researchers were insurmountable,
databases provide solutions to each.  In this paper, we encourage researchers
to consider using databases as an alternative to the simple rectangular table
in order to minimize time spent updating and combining data, provide for
sharing data safely, and properly and efficiently represent data that cross
row boundaries of typical tables.  In the remainder of this article we
describe several types of databases and provide examples of real world social
science usage that addresses the problems faced by our example researchers. In
the final section, we also highlight several features that databases, such as
speed advantages for large datasets and tools for geographic and spatial data.
